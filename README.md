This is a small tool to automate `xcrun simctl` command via iOS Simulator unit and UI tests.

Simctl requires Xcode 11.4 - see <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode_release_notes/>.   
Swift Argument Parser requires Swift 5.2 to build releases - see <https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser/issues/80>

This is a work in progress.
